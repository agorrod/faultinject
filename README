This is a library that allows for fault injection testing by intercepting
system calls.

It will be configured by setting environment variables.

TODO:
* Add python generator script to makefile
* Implement generic environment variable handling

* It is not obvious how to make this work without LD_PRELOAD. LD_PRELOAD
  causes difficulties if you only want to intercept (or alter) calls that come
  via one of several libraries. For example if using WiredTiger via the Python
  API, it isn't desirable to alter the behavior of the Python functions.
  It is possible to build WiredTiger against faultinject and have faultinject
  load when WiredTiger is dynamically loaded into Python, but by then the
  symbols aren't overridden. It may be possible to forcibly overide the
  symbols in the faultinject static initializer - but I suspect that would also
  override them for the Python executable as well.
